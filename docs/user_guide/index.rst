Overview
--------

Remote OpenFAST Plotter provides a web-based interface for interacting with OpenFAST output files. The application is organized into several tabs:

* **Files Tab**: Loading and managing OpenFAST output files
* **Time Domain Tab**: Creating time series plots of simulation data
* **FFT Tab**: Performing frequency domain analysis
* **Phase Tab**: Examining phase relationships between signals

Basic Workflow
-------------

A typical workflow with the Remote OpenFAST Plotter consists of:

1. **Loading Files**: Add OpenFAST output files to the application
2. **Selecting Signals**: Choose which data channels to analyze
3. **Creating Plots**: Generate visualizations in time or frequency domain
4. **Annotating**: Add markers for important frequencies or events
5. **Exporting**: Save plots as standalone HTML files for sharing
