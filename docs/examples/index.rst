Basic Workflow
-------------

The :doc:`basic_workflow` example demonstrates a complete workflow from loading OpenFAST files to exporting results, covering:

* Loading simulation output files
* Creating time domain plots
* Performing basic FFT analysis
* Exporting results as HTML

Time Series Analysis
------------------

The :doc:`time_series_analysis` example focuses on time domain analysis techniques:

* Comparing signals across multiple files
* Using time range selections
* Identifying transient events
* Applying signal filtering

FFT Analysis
----------

The :doc:`fft_analysis` example covers frequency domain analysis:

* Configuring FFT parameters for optimal results
* Using different averaging methods
* Identifying system natural frequencies
* Working with the frequency annotation system

Phase Analysis
------------

The :doc:`phase_analysis` example demonstrates phase relationship analysis:

* Setting up reference signals
* Interpreting magnitude and phase plots
* Identifying resonance conditions
* Comparing phase across different operational conditions

Working with Annotations
---------------------

The :doc:`annotations` example provides practical guidance for:

* Creating effective annotation sets
* Using color coding effectively
* Harmonics identification
* Comparing peaks with analytical predictions
